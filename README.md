## 🧠 Overview
  
**Civix** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and resolving local civic issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, and uncollected garbage. It provides a bridge between citizens and municipal authorities, bringing accountability and transparency to local issue resolution.

## 🚨 Problem Addressed
