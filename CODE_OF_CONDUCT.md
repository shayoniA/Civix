## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and may take any appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
