## 🧠 Overview 

**Civix** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and resolving local civic issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, and uncollected garbage. It provides a bridge between citizens and municipal authorities, bringing accountability and transparency to local issue resolution.

---

- 📸Citizens to report problems easily with images and geolocation.

- 🔁Transparent status tracking of reported issues.

- 🔼Community-driven prioritization via upvotes.

- 🧑‍💼A centralized admin dashboard for city workers to manage and resolve issues efficiently.

## 🌗 Dark Mode Toggle  

Civix supports a **light and dark mode toggle** to enhance user experience in different lighting conditions. This feature allows users to switch between a light theme and a dark theme with a single click.

### 🔧 Setup Details

- `darkMode: 'class'` is enabled in `tailwind.config.js`
- User preference is saved using `localStorage`
- Toggle switch is implemented in `src/ThemeToggle.jsx`
- Imported and used inside `Home.jsx`, beside the "Sign Up" button

### How to Use

- **Locate the Toggle Button**: In the header of the app, look for the toggle button displaying a moon (🌙) or sun (☀️) icon.
- **Switch Modes**:
  - If the moon icon (🌙) is visible, click it to switch to dark mode.
  - If the sun icon (☀️) is visible, click it to switch to light mode.
- **Visual Changes**: The app will update instantly:
  - **Light Mode**: White or light gray backgrounds (e.g., `bg-slate-50`) with dark text (e.g., `text-gray-900`).
  - **Dark Mode**: Dark gray backgrounds (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-800`) with light text (e.g., `dark:text-gray-100`).
